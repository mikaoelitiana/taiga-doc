FAQs
----

[[faq-change-domain]]
How can I change the domain name?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The domain name mainly affects the frontend application, because it needs to comunicate with the
backend through the domain/public-ip.

To do this you should update the url value `api` on frontend config file `dist/conf/conf.json`.
Also you should update the domain related configuration on the backend settings file:
`settings/local.py`.

And finally reload the backend config with: `circusctl reload taiga`



[[restrict-emails-to-domain]]
How can I restrict registration to a concrete domain?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can restrict the usage of the platform to a set of valid email domains, so
this allows you to restrict the registration to users that have a valid company
email account.

To do this you should update the `USER_EMAIL_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` on your
`settings/local.py` and add the list of valid domains, for example, if you want
to allow registrations only from `mycompany.com` and `mycustomer.com`, y can
set it as:

[source,python]
----
USER_EMAIL_ALLOWED_DOMAINS = ["mycompany.com", "mycustomer.com"]
----

And finally reload the backend config with: `circusctl reload taiga`


[[faq-restart-backend]]
How can I restart the backend application?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Backend application is running under circus. To restart any application running
with circus use the `circusctl` command:

[source,bash]
----
circusctl restart taiga
----

In case taiga-celery is configured restart it too:

[source,bash]
----
circusctl restart taiga-celery
----

[[faq-add-extra-functionality]]
How I can add extra functionality to Taiga?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Taiga allows adding functionality through contrib plugins. The installation of each
plugin depends on the plugin itself and must be documented in the plugin
repository.

The current supported plugins are:

* link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-contrib-cookie-warning[taiga-contrib-cookie-warning] A funny cookie warning message
* link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-contrib-github-auth[taiga-contrib-github-auth]: GitHub Authentication
* link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-contrib-gogs[taiga-contrib-gogs]: Gogs integration
* link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-contrib-hipchat[taiga-contrib-hipchat]: HipChat integration
* link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-contrib-letschat[taiga-contrib-letschat]: Let's Chat integration
* link:https://github.com/taigaio/taiga-contrib-slack[taiga-contrib-slack]: Slack integration


[[faq-backup]]
How I can make a backup of the data? And then restore them?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To backup data from your server you just need to store a copy of the database and attachments files. That is, You just need to make a dump of the database and a copy of `taiga-back/media directory`.

1. Create dump:

[source,bash]
----
pg_dump taiga > taiga.sql
----

2.C opy media to a `<dest>`:

[source,bash]
----
cp -r taiga-back/media <dest>
----

Then You can restore the backup creating a new database to load the dump and copying the media directory:

[source,bash]
----
createdb taiga
psql taiga < taiga.sql
cp -r <dest> taiga-back/media
----


Common Bugs
-----------

[[bug-unicodeencodeerror]]
UnicodeEncodeError
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have some error like this:

----
  File "/home/taiga/taiga-back/taiga/projects/services/invitations.py", line 17, in send_invitation
    email.send()
  File "/home/taiga/.virtualenvs/taiga/lib/python3.4/site-packages/django/core/mail/message.py", line 286, in send
    return self.get_connection(fail_silently).send_messages([self])
  File "/home/taiga/.virtualenvs/taiga/lib/python3.4/site-packages/django/core/mail/backends/console.py", line 36, in send_messages
    self.write_message(message)
  File "/home/taiga/.virtualenvs/taiga/lib/python3.4/site-packages/django/core/mail/backends/console.py", line 23, in write_message
    self.stream.write('%s\n' % msg_data)
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character '\xfc' in position 487: ordinal not in range(128)
----

You have to change the locale of your system to someone that support UTF8 characters. To fix it
add to the taiga user `.bashrc` file this lines:

if you have a German Linux machine, you can fix the problem by exporting the locale to `de_DE.UTF-8`:

[source,bash]
----
export LANG=de_DE.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=de_DE.UTF-8
export LC_TYPE=de_DE.UTF-8
----

If you are on a US machine, en_US.utf-8 is the encoding of choice. On some newer Linux systems,
you could also try `en_US.UTF-8` as the locale:

[source,bash]
----
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LC_TYPE=en_US.UTF-8
----

Restart the shell, or the machine, and try again.

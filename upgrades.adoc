How to upgrade Taiga
====================
:toc: left

The Taiga platform is developed on github. For consistences you should alway maintain the same version
in time with the *stable* branch of git or use the last major version of each component.

**No packaged version of Taiga is available at this moment.**

.Frontend application
[source,bash]
----
cd ~/taiga-front-dist
git checkout stable
git pull
----

.Backend application
----
As user "taiga" or whatever user you use, do not run this code as "root" to avoid errors.
cd ~/taiga-back
git checkout stable
workon taiga
git pull
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate --noinput
python manage.py compilemessages
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
circusctl reload taiga
----

In case taiga-celery is configured reload it too:

[source,bash]
----
circusctl reload taiga-celery
----


Upgrades notes
--------------

1.9.0 > 1.9.1
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy your conf.json from `taiga-front-dist/dist/js/conf.json` to `taiga-front-dist/dist/conf.json`.

Remove the following folders `dist/fonts`, `dist/images`, `dist/js`, `dist/locales`, `dist/styles`, `dist/svg`.

Download the latest plugins version following their installation instructions.


1.9.1 > 1.10.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the default process.

The migration could take a long time if you have a large database.


1.10.0 > 2.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the default process.

This version upgrade Django to 1.9, so if you overwrited the DB settings in `taiga-back/settings/local.py` you have to change the DB backend to use the default one.

So, change...

[source,python]
----
# In Taiga <= 1.9
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "transaction_hooks.backends.postgresql_psycopg2",
        (...)
----

to:

[source,python]
----
# In Taiga >= 2.0
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        (...)
----


2.0.0 > 2.1.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the default process.

2.1.0 > 3.0.0 (extra step for instances with gogs plugin installed)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Taiga contrib gogs plugin has been moved to taiga core so in case you installed the plugin you must uninstall it:

- In `taiga-back/settings/local.py`
    * Remove `taiga_contrib_gogs` from your `INSTALLED_APPS`
    * Remove the `PROJECT_MODULES_CONFIGURATORS["gogs"]` setting added

- In `taiga-front/dist/conf.json` remove `/plugins/gogs/gogs.json` from the `contribPlugins` section
- In `taiga-front/dist/plugins` remove the folder `gogs`


2.1.0 > 3.0.0 (all installations)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Follow the default process.


The migration could take a long time if you have a large database: now a new permissions has been included to allow to add comments instead of use the __modify object permission__ for this purpose.

Now project templates can be sorted and a new permission has been added to allow users to add comments. The fixtures must reloaded using:

----
cd taiga-back
workon taiga
python manage.py loaddata initial_project_templates --traceback
----
